/// ## 0.1.0 - UNRELEASED
/// - NOTICE: Release numbering reset
/// - BREAKING: We now use the shared syntax
///   defined in [the core module](core.html) --
///   which requires `#tags` for internal map reference,
///   and provides a number of new features.
/// - BREAKING: Ratio functionality merged into [Core](core.html),
///   using the shared `$ratios` map,
///   and `ratio()` function.
///   The old `$aspect-ratios` and `aspect-ratio()` have been removed.

/// ## Previous Releases (Old Numbering)…
/// @group layout-changelog


/// ### layout-3.0.2 – 09/13/17
/// - BUGFIX: Allow [accoutrement-scale](http://oddbird.net/accoutrement-scale/)
///   adjustments on breakpoints, when the package is available
/// @group layout-changelog


/// ### layout-3.0.1 – 09/13/17
/// - Update docs.
/// @group layout-changelog


/// ### layout-3.0.0 – 09/12/17
/// - BREAKING: All pseudo-elements (box-sizing, cleafix) use proper `::` syntax.
/// - BREAKING: Nested items in the `$z-index` list start with `1` rather than `2`,
///   so that `main, nav item dropdown, overlay`
///   will generate indexes of `1, 2 1 2, 3` respectively.
///   This matches more closely the way nested z-indexes work in the browser.
/// - BREAKING: Remove `$inherit` option from `box-sizing`
///   (because it's a bad idea to inherit box properties).
///   You can still replicate the behavior by setting box-sizing on the root,
///   and passing `inherit` as an argument to the mixin.
/// - BREAKING: Remove `micro-clearfix` in favor of `clearfix` alias.
///   The only other reliable clearfix is `overflow: hidden` -
///   and we don't need a mixin for that.
/// - BREAKING: Remove `$accoutrement-query-context` and `_apply-query()`
///   for lack of use-cases.
/// - BREAKING: Rename `$_ACCOUTREMENT-ASPECT-RATIOS`
///   to make it private, and signify that it remains constant.
/// - BREAKING: Remove automatic `browser-ems` conversion,
///   in favor of explicit breakpoint values/units.
///   For unit-conversion and more helpful size-utilities,
///   see [Accoutrement-Scale](http://oddbird.net/accoutrement-scale/).
///   Also remove `$_BROWSER-DEFAULT-FONT-SIZE`, since it's no longer needed.
/// - BREAKING: `rem` values are treated like `em` values
///   when removing media-query overlap.
/// - BREAKING: Remove `stretch` mixins, as an over-specific use-case.
/// - NEW: Add a single `position` mixin using the common TRBL syntax
///   to provide a shortcut for positioning properties
///   (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `position`).
/// @group layout-changelog


/// ### layout-2.2.0 - 04/26/17
/// - BREAKING: Remove `1px` or `0.01em` from `max-` property queries,
///   to remove potential overlap
/// @group layout-changelog


/// ### layout-2.1.1 - 04/17/17-
/// - BUGFIX: Improved logical hierarchy for accessing named querise
///   across both `$breakpoints` and (accoutrement-scale) `$sizes`
/// - TESTING: Update True, and add tests for `_get-breakpoint`
/// @group layout-changelog


/// ### layout-2.1.0 - 05/23/16-
/// - NEW: Named z-index tools
/// @group layout-changelog


/// ### layout-2.0.0 - 02/25/16-
/// - BREAKING: Remove Bower support
/// - NEW: Named media-query tools
/// - NEW: Intrinsic ratio tools
/// @group layout-changelog


/// ### layout-1.1.0 - 05/13/15-
/// - NEW: Global box-sizing mixin
/// @group layout-changelog
