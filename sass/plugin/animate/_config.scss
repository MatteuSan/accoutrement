/// # Third-Party Functions
/// We provide a standard set of
/// [math functions](./math.html)
/// for manipulating [time values](./times.html),
/// but you can also use third-party (or Sass-native) functions.
/// Because Sass 3.5+ requires first-class functions,
/// we provide a single place to store & manage functions
/// that you would like to use with Accoutrement Animate.
/// @group functions


// Functions
// ---------
/// Define any third-party functions required
/// by your `$times`, `$easing`, or `$changes` maps.
/// This is only necessary for newer versions of Sass,
/// where functions are first-class,
/// and can be captured using `get-function($name)`.
///
/// ```scss
/// $functions: (
///   'times': get-function('times'),
///   'divide': get-function('divide'),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// @group functions
/// @type map
$functions: () !default;
